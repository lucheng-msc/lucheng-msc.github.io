       <h1>Stanford Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition Course (Review)</h1>
<p>If you're late to the DL game, this is an exceptional resource. </p>
<br>
<p>A number of us (myself included) have taken the course, and can vouch for it</p>
<br>
<p>The Stanford course on deep learning for computer vision is perhaps the most widely known course on the topic.</p>
<br>
<p>This is not surprising given that the course has been running for four years, is presented by top academics and researchers in the field, and the course lectures and notes are made freely available.</p>
<br>
<p>This is an incredible resource for students and deep learning practitioners alike.</p>
<br>
<p>In this post, you will discover a gentle introduction to this course that you can use to get a jump-start on computer vision with deep learning methods.</p>
<br>
<p>After reading this post, you will know:</p>
<br>
<p>The breakdown of the course including who teaches it, how long it has been taught, and what it covers.</p>
<p>The breakdown of the lectures in the course including the three lectures to focus on if you are already familiar with deep learning.</p>
<p>A review of the course, including how it compares to similar courses on the same subject matter.</p>
<p>Let’s get started.</p>
